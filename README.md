# Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python-Nanodegree-Program
My repository contains the second and third projects for the Udacity nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program"


**Project 2**

In this project, you as the student is required to make use of Python to explore data related to a bike share system. 
This is set in 3 major cities in the United States, namely:
Chicago, 
New York City, and 
Washington. 

You are required to write code to import the data from csv's and then answer some question this data by computing descriptive statistics, as well as writing some code to import raw data to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
